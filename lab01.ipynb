When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like so: `[1]`. The number corresponds to the order in which you run the cells; so, the first cell you run will show a 1 when it's finished running, the second will show a 2, and so on. \n",

Next, click **Control Panel** at the top right. Choose **Stop My Server** to shut it down, then **Start My Server** to start it back up. Then, navigate back to the notebook you were working on.
